# Python style

This is the style guide for Python code in `xsdformer`. It's the
high-level / human-judgement layer — the mechanical formatting and
naming rules are enforced by [ruff] and aren't restated here. If
something contradicts what ruff is configured to enforce, ruff wins,
and this doc should be updated.

The content is largely lifted from the
[Google Python Style Guide][pyguide] (CC-BY-3.0), edited for the
conventions of this repo. Sections we don't enforce or that ruff
already covers have been omitted.

## Imports

**Import modules, not symbols.** Use `import x` to bring in a package
or module. Use `from x import y` only when `y` is itself a module
(i.e. `x` is the package prefix). Do not use `from x import y` to
bring in a class, function, constant, or other symbol.

Why: at the call site, a qualified reference (`module.Thing`) makes
it clear where `Thing` came from. A bare `Thing` is ambiguous to
anyone reading the file — and to AI assistants navigating the code —
without scrolling to the import block.

```python
# Good
import pathlib
import dataclasses

path = pathlib.Path('/etc/hostname')

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Record:
    name: str

# Bad — symbols pulled out of their module
from pathlib import Path
from dataclasses import dataclass

path = Path('/etc/hostname')

@dataclass
class Record:
    name: str
```

The cost is a little extra typing at call sites. It's worth it.

### Carved-out exceptions

The following symbol imports are allowed:

- Names from the `typing` module (`Any`, `Protocol`, `TypeVar`,
  `NamedTuple`, etc.). These are language vocabulary; fully-qualifying
  them adds noise without clarity.
- Names from `collections.abc` (`Iterator`, `Iterable`, `Mapping`,
  `Sequence`, etc.). Same rationale.
- `from __future__ import ...` — required syntax for future
  statements, not a normal import.

Anything not on this list — including `pathlib.Path`,
`dataclasses.dataclass`, `contextlib.contextmanager`,
`functools.partial`, project-internal classes — should be accessed
via its module.

### No `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks

Don't use `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING` to gate type-only imports.
The pattern is an ugly two-tier import structure and almost always
papers over a problem that's better fixed elsewhere:

- If the import is type-only because of a *circular import*, the
  abstractions are usually wrong. Restructure the modules.
- If the import is type-only because the library is *expensive to
  import* at runtime (`hail`, `torch`, `sqlalchemy`), the legitimate
  exceptions are rare in this codebase — handle them case-by-case
  with an inline comment justifying the block.

For everything else (`Iterator`, `Iterable`, `Sequence` from
`collections.abc`), import at module level. The runtime cost is
nothing.

```python
# Good
from collections.abc import Iterator

def lines(source: str) -> Iterator[str]:
    ...

# Bad — Iterator costs nothing to import; the block is pure noise
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from collections.abc import Iterator

def lines(source: str) -> Iterator[str]:
    ...
```

## Exception handling

Make use of built-in exception classes when it makes sense. For
example, raise a `ValueError` if you were passed a negative number but
were expecting a positive one. Do not use `assert` statements for
validating argument values of a public API. `assert` is used to ensure
internal correctness, not to enforce correct usage nor to indicate
that some unexpected event occurred.

Narrow `except` clauses to the specific exceptions you can actually
handle. Never use bare `except:` — it catches `KeyboardInterrupt` and
`SystemExit` too. Never silently swallow an exception; at minimum log
it, ideally re-raise with added context using `raise ... from`.

```python
# Good
try:
    return parse_config(path)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    raise ConfigError(f'invalid JSON in {path}') from e

# Bad
try:
    return parse_config(path)
except Exception:
    return {}  # caller has no way to know the file was invalid
```

## Mutable global state

Avoid module-level mutable state. Module globals that get mutated at
runtime are effectively a hidden parameter to every function in the
module — they make code hard to test, hard to reason about under
concurrency, and surprising when the module is imported twice.

Constants are fine. Caches, registries, and similar should usually be
attached to an explicit object or scoped to a function.

```python
# Good — caller owns the state
def build_index(records: Iterable[Record]) -> dict[str, Record]:
    return {r.id: r for r in records}

# Bad — every caller now shares this dictionary
_INDEX: dict[str, Record] = {}

def add_to_index(r: Record) -> None:
    _INDEX[r.id] = r
```

## Resource management

Always use the `with` statement for resources that need explicit
cleanup — files, sockets, network connections, locks, database
transactions, subprocesses. Don't rely on garbage collection to close
them.

```python
# Good
with open(path) as f:
    data = f.read()

# Bad — file stays open until the GC gets to it
f = open(path)
data = f.read()
```

For objects without a context-manager protocol, wrap them with
`contextlib.closing` rather than calling `.close()` manually in a
`finally` block.

## Power features

Avoid metaclasses, monkey-patching, dynamic class creation, `eval`,
`exec`, custom `__getattr__` / `__setattr__` magic, and reflective
hacks. These features exist for legitimate library-level use cases,
but in application code they almost always make the code harder to
read, harder to type-check, and harder for tools (including AI
assistants) to reason about.

If you find yourself reaching for a power feature, the problem is
usually that an abstraction is missing or wrong; fix that instead.

## Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings on public APIs that warrant explanation.
Public APIs *should* have docstrings; this is policy, not lint —
ruff's `D1xx` rules are disabled, so missing docstrings won't fail
CI. The review prompt nudges authors toward adding them.

When a docstring exists, its format is enforced by ruff (Google
convention). Beyond format, the *content* matters:

- **Module docstring**: what the module is for; what to use it for.
- **Function/method docstring**: what the caller needs to know to call
  it correctly. Not a paraphrase of the implementation.
- **Class docstring**: the invariant the class maintains, plus any
  important behaviour the class name doesn't already imply.

The standard sections are `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`, `Yields:`.

```python
# Good
def merge_base(head: str, base: str) -> str:
    """Resolve the merge base of two commits.

    Args:
        head: SHA of the PR head commit.
        base: SHA of the PR base commit (usually `main`).

    Returns:
        The merge-base SHA as a hex string.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If `git merge-base` returns
            a non-zero exit code (commits unknown, no common ancestor).
    """
    ...

# Bad — restates the code without adding signal
def merge_base(head: str, base: str) -> str:
    """Call git merge-base with head and base and return the output."""
    ...
```

## Type annotations

Annotations should be present on function and method signatures
(enforced by ruff's `ANN` rules), and should be *specific*. Annotation
is policy not lint when it comes to specificity:

- Prefer concrete types over `typing.Any`. `Any` is banned outright
  (`ANN401` is in ruff's select). If you find yourself needing it,
  consider whether a `Protocol`, `TypeVar`, or `Union` would carry
  more signal.
- Prefer `list[Dataset]` over bare `list`. The element type carries
  meaning.
- Prefer `Iterable[T]` / `Sequence[T]` / `Mapping[K, V]` for function
  parameters (the most general type the function actually uses); use
  concrete `list` / `dict` for return types.
- Don't annotate the obvious. `def __init__(self, name: str) -> None`
  is fine; `def f(self) -> Self` is fine; `def add(a: int, b: int) ->
  int: return a + b` is fine. Don't add `# type: Iterable[int]`
  comments inside a function unless pyright is confused.

## Function decomposition

A function should do one thing. Pyguide's loose target is "under 40
lines"; if you're well above that, the function is probably doing
more than one thing. Decompose along natural boundaries — input
parsing, the core operation, formatting the output — rather than
chopping arbitrarily.

A function that's structurally simple but long (e.g. a config
generator with 100 sequential `setattr` calls) is fine. A function
that's 50 lines of branching, where each branch is a different mode
of operation, is not — those branches want to be separate functions.

## Tooling notes

### `from __future__ import annotations`

Use it. Every Python module in this repo should start with
`from __future__ import annotations` (after the module docstring, if
present). It makes all annotations lazily-evaluated strings, which:

- Removes runtime ordering dependencies for forward references.
- Lets us use `list[int]` / `X | Y` annotations without worrying about
  Python version.
- Means the cost of an unused type-only import is the import cost
  only, not the resolution cost — supporting the "no `TYPE_CHECKING`"
  stance above.

### pytest

Test files use `pytest`, not `unittest`. Test functions are top-level
or grouped under classes named `Test*`. Assertions use bare
`assert` — ruff's `S101` is ignored under `tests/**` exactly so
pytest-style assertions are allowed there.

```python
# Good — pytest style
def test_merge_base_returns_a_sha():
    assert _looks_like_a_sha(merge_base('HEAD~1', 'HEAD'))

# Bad — unittest style in this repo
class MergeBaseTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_returns_a_sha(self):
        self.assertTrue(...)
```

Use `pytest` fixtures (`tmp_path`, `monkeypatch`, `capsys`,
custom-defined) for setup, not class-level setup methods. Parametrise
tests with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` rather than writing N
near-identical test functions.
